FILE DESCRIPTIONS
------------------

1.) A Makefile to build our source files with clean, dist, and build options supported.
2.) This README file, describing our project and including our information
3.) lab3a.c - this file includes all of our implemented code for this project. 
    we created many different helper functions to assist us in our programming efforts.
    These are: 
	- get_gmt_time: convert a time given in time since the epoch to a string 
	  formatted in the way described for the inode modified, accessed, and created
	  fields
        - scan_bitmap: which takes in an area to scan individual bits of the bitmap,
	  and converts it to an array
	- offset_from_block: which takes in a block number and block size and returns the
	  absolute offset of it in bytes
	- fs_read_offset - read into the filesystem file at a specified offset and for a 
	  certain length, storing what we get in a buffer
	- populate_field_from_buf - given a pointer to a variable we want to fill up, the
	  field's size and where to read it from in the buffer, populate it with data from
	  the buffer
	- Malloc - wrapped version of malloc() with descriptive error reporting
    We also have some meatier functions that implement most of the functionality
    These are:
	- read_super_block: read all of the super block's attributes and store them in a
	  struct
	- read_group_block_descriptor: read all of the group block descriptor's attributes
	  and store them in a struct
	- inode_summary: iterate through the inodes and get a description for each of them
	  parse them as directories if they are, and if they are not symbolic links, parse
	  their indirect blocks, if any
	- scan directory: print out directory inodes entries
	

LIMITATIONS
-----------
This project leverages information given by Alexandre in regards to the fact that there is
only one block group.
