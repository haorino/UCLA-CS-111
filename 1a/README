lab1a.c:
The source code for the lab.
Supports --shell option -> instantiates a shell ("/bin/bash") or a custom shell if specified with the program argument 
Supports --debug option -> prints various helpful debug statements throughout execution
Default execution, puts terminal into non-cannonical non echo mode and echos the user's keystrokes to the screen
Miscellaneous info on lab1a.c
^D - exits (for shell option, send EOF - thus resulting in an eventual exit - after the child process stops as well)
^C - for shell option only - sends interrupt signal to shell - causing an eventual shutdown
Contains 'protected system calls' - functions that make system calls with error checking, making the coding process easier
If shell option specified:
Uses fork() - to start a new child process that executes the shell and communicates to the parent
managing the terminal via pipes
Prevents blocking by using poll() and poll_fds structures.
Returns the shell exit status - using waitpid()
Errors are descriptive as strerror(errno) is used to elaborate on the error message (indicated by exit code (1))
atexit was used to specify a standard routine whenever exit() is called, instead of manually issuing multiple function calls

Makefile:
default -> builds the prokect
clean -> deletes all object files, shared objects, dSYM folder and any other possible residue from working in the directory
dist -> builds the tar ball with the z option for .tar.gz extension
