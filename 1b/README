Disables regular terminal modes and replaces with non cannonical non echo mode
Takes option to do with port
Sets up socket with local host at the specif port
If connection is successful, starts read or poll function which constantly polls for input from keyboard and socket
if input is received, it writes to the stdout and the socket (encrypted if encrypt flag specified) (logs it as well if log option specified)
on shutdown restores regular terminal modes
in case 0 bytes are sent closes the socket assuming no more transmission
